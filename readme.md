Vocabulary Flash Cards for Unit I of *Wheelock's Latin*
=======================================================

Overview & Purpose of the Application
-------------------------------------
*Latin Teachers (Non-technical) & Developers*

The purpose of this application is to allow beginning Latin students to drill themselves on vocabulary from the first unit in Frederic M. Wheelock's popular Latin textbook. The vocabulary is limited primarily to verbs of the first and second conjugations; however, it also includes a smattering of pronouns, nouns, adverbs, and conjunctions, which allow the construction of some very basic *sententiae*.

The application will allow students to cycle through randomized vocabulary flash cards. Each student will be presented with with a Latin word and will be prompted to enter the English definition of the word. If that response is correct, the card will be removed from the virtual stack of flash cards. If the response is incorrect, the card will be returned to the bottom of the "pile." This process will continue until the student has successfully provided the correct English definition for each Latin prompt.

Future versions of this application may include enhancements such as these:
* Ability for the user to switch back and forth between English-to-Latin and Latin-to-English
* Ability for students to create their own flash cards and drill themselves on those cards
* Pictures displayed with each card to reinforce the meaning of the words displayed therein

Gold, Silver, & Bronze versions
-------------------------------
*Developers*

The **Bronze** version of this application should, at a minimum, include a square or rectangular card containing the word being drilled, and it should prompt the user to enter text, which will be checked against the provided translation. At first, the app will only drill Latin-to-English vocabulary, as this will be easier for the user to enter and easier to check against than a long set of Latin forms including verb principal parts, for example. This version should have just enough CSS to make it clear that it is a flash card drill. The app will keep track of which cards were correct and which ones were incorrect and will provide a simple alert to the user about whether he or she got the word right or not.

The **Silver** version of the app should have all the same functionality as the Bronze version described above; however, it should include improvements to styling, including background images, buttons, etc. The primary concern of this step will be the CSS, as the baseline functionality will already be in place in the Bronze version.

The **Gold** version of this application should have all the features described in the preceding section: a pleasant UX design is very important to making the experience less painful for the student, who will likely be very frustrated with his or her ability to retain and reproduce the vocabulary items. This version might also include some CSS animations and transitions for cycling through the cards, and perhaps some end of game success screen. Another Gold feature would be responsive design, which would allow users to drill vocabulary on their phones without having to squint to see the words on their screens.
